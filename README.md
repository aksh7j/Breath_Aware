🌍 BreathAware: A Machine Learning-Based Early Warning System for Pollution-Induced Health Risks
📌 Project Overview

BreathAware is a machine learning project designed to predict and provide early warnings for pollution-induced health risks in India. Using the Time-Series Air Quality Data of India (2010–2023)
, the system forecasts air quality trends and maps them to potential respiratory health risks.

The ultimate goal is to help policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens take proactive measures against hazardous air quality conditions.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical air quality data across multiple Indian cities.

Forecast Air Quality Index (AQI) trends using ML and time-series models.

Correlate AQI levels with health risk categories.

Provide an early warning system via dashboards and predictive models.
